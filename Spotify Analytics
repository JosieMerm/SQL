# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

#Which artist had the most songs on the list and how many songs did they have?
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(artist_name) FROM Spotifydata GROUP BY artist_name ORDER BY COUNT(artist_name) DESC LIMIT 1;

#What songs have a danceability above average?
SELECT track_name FROM Spotifydata WHERE danceability > (SELECT AVG(danceability) FROM Spotifydata) ORDER BY danceability DESC;

#Who are the 3 most popular artists and which song of theirs has the highest energy?
SELECT artist_name, track_name FROM Spotifydata WHERE artist_name IN (SELECT artist_name FROM Spotifydata ORDER BY popularity DESC LIMIT 3) GROUP BY artist_name ORDER BY MAX(energy) DESC;
